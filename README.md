A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

### Redux Toolkit

The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:

1) Configuring a Redux store is too complicated
1) I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful
1) Redux requires too much boilerplate code
